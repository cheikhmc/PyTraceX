# PyTraceX

**PyTraceX** is a lightweight and extensible Python library designed for **execution flow tracing**, **audit logging**, **correlation ID tracking**, **ML pipeline monitoring**, and **file I/O tracing**. It provides a seamless way to capture, analyze, and manage system interactions, all while maintaining a minimal footprint and high configurability.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Function Execution Tracing**  
  Capture function calls, execution time, and input arguments automatically.

- **Audit Logging**  
  Securely log critical operations with tamper-proof signatures.

- **Correlation ID Tracking**  
  Associate correlation IDs with requests to enable distributed tracing across microservices.

- **ML Pipeline Monitoring**  
  Track data transformations, preprocessing, and model training workflows.

- **File I/O Tracing**  
  Monitor file operations such as reading, writing, and closing files with built-in tracking.

- **Real-Time Execution Monitoring** *(Optional)*  
  A web-based dashboard for interactive monitoring and visualization.

- **Configurable and Extensible**  
  Supports in-memory storage by default, with the option to integrate databases or other external systems.

## üìå Key Benefits

- **Minimal Dependencies**  
  Uses only standard Python libraries by default, ensuring lightweight deployment.

- **Plug-and-Play Decorators**  
  Easily add tracing, logging, and monitoring to existing functions with simple annotations.

- **Production-Ready**  
  Designed for both local development and large-scale distributed systems.

- **Security & Compliance**  
  Includes tamper-proof event logging and configurable **PII masking** for data protection.

## üõ† Configuration

PyTraceX is **highly configurable**, allowing users to define:
- Custom logging formats and verbosity.
- Secure hashing mechanisms for audit logs.
- PII masking rules to anonymize sensitive data.
- Storage backends for trace event persistence.

All configurations are easily adjustable to fit different use cases.

## üìä Real-Time Monitoring *(Optional)*

For those who require **real-time trace visibility**, PyTraceX offers an optional web-based dashboard.  
This allows users to:
- View recorded function calls and events.
- Monitor live execution logs.
- Filter and search trace events dynamically.

---

## üéØ Use Cases

PyTraceX is designed for a wide range of applications, including:
- **Debugging complex execution flows** in microservices and distributed systems.
- **Enhancing observability** in data pipelines and machine learning workflows.
- **Ensuring compliance** with secure logging for sensitive operations.
- **Tracking file interactions** in automated workflows and backend systems.

Its modular design makes it adaptable to both **small-scale scripts** and **enterprise-level applications**.
